    <p>
            We are entirely dedicated to providing our guests with the very finest quality cuisine, exceptional service and genuine hospitality at our extraordinary landmark locations and award-winning restaurants.</p>

<p>Our award-winning culinary innovation, hospitality and personalized services are the foundation of what make us a leader in the premium segment of the restaurant industry. Our connection to culture and the arts is also a fundamental component of our company.</p>

<p>Patina Restaurant Group was built on the belief that culinary excellence is an art form, and that a superb visit to a cultural venue should be matched with equally inspired cuisine. Museums, cultural centers and art-filled landmark locations provide the ideal environments for experiencing our high level of quality and service—after all, a visit to view a Marc Chagall art display is commemorative in its own right, but an exceptional culinary dish completes the package perfectly.</P>

<p>Patina Restaurant Group’s founders, celebrated restaurateur Nick Valenti and leading chef Joachim Splichal, shared a common vision of a premium, world-class restaurant and food service company. Now showcasing approximately 65 locations in restaurants and performing arts centers across the country, Patina Restaurant Group offers elegant fine dining and personalized service for special events, weddings, catered affairs and corporate gatherings of any size. The amalgamation of these two culinary innovators has presented the world with an unsurpassed level of service and unrivaled culinary talent.</p>
